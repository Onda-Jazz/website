Experience the NCMA after dark. Share small plates with friends. Wander the galleries. Relax with a glass of wine and live music. The lobby-turned-lounge in the West Building is a great place to kick off the weekend with Brazilian jazz provided by Onda.

Admittance is free.

Small plates, beverages, wine, and beer are available for purchase.
