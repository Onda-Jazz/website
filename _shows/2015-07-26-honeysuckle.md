Situated on a beautiful farm just west of Chapel Hill, Honeysuckle Tea House is a unique community-centered venue.

Onda looks forward to returning to the Tea House.

The Honeysuckle Tea House rests upon 16 acres which includes the tea house itself, a natural play area for children, shipping containers to aid in cultivating medicinal and edible mushrooms,  2 acres of organically grown medicinal herbs, a small nursery for those who wish to start their own or expand their medicinal herb garden, and almost 8 acres of various fruit and tea plants for the enjoyment and nourishment of the community.
