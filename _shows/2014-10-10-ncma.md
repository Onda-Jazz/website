Experience the NCMA after dark. Share small plates with friends. Wander the galleries. Relax with a glass of wine and live music. The lobby-turned-lounge in the new West Building is a great place to kick off the weekend with Onda Jazz, friends, food and drink!

Admittance is FREE!

Small plates and beverages, including wine, beer, and nonalcoholic options, are available for purchase.
