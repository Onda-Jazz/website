Catrina Godwin and Matthew Bettinger created an ideal jazz venue in the heart of Glenwood South. C. Grace offers exceptional cocktails and a speakeasy atmosphere that invites you to linger.

Onda looks forward to bringing our Brazilian jazz tunes to this beautiful stage. We promise that it absolutely will be worth coming out on a "school night" for this show!

No cover charge. Please enjoy a tasty beverage instead.
