Nelson, Eric, Ana, and special guest pianist [Noah Sager](http://noahsagermusic.com/){:target="_blank"} present an evening of Brazilian jazz.

Irregardless is a true Raleigh institution. Welcoming atmosphere, great food, great service, and a wonderful place to hear Onda perform. Dress up if you like, or not, but definitely plan on being there when we return to Irregardless on Saturday February 28. The show starts at 9pm, and the dance floor will be open.
