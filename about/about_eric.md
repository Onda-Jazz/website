I have always been moved to create. This led me to immerse myself in numerous endeavors including photography, theater, computer programming, and music. I played guitar in high school but took what ended up being a 20-year hiatus. In 2008, inspired by listening to local musicians, I decided that I wanted to play music again. I studied guitar with [Jon Shain](http://www.jonshain.com/) and [Kevin Van Sant](http://www.kevinvansant.com/), but my journey into bass began almost by accident. I was playing guitar at a blues jam in 2011, and the bass player had to leave early. I said, “I know nothing about playing bass, but I will give it a try.” Playing bass felt very intuitive to me. In 2012, I bought an upright bass and began lessons with [Robbie Link](http://robbielink.com/).

For me playing music is about collaboration - both with other musicians and with an audience. I welcome opportunities for collaboration, and enjoy playing a wide variety of genres of music.

I play regularly with these projects:

* Onda
* The Nelson Johns/Eric Meyer duo
* The Cool Jazz 21 trio, which plays every Tuesday night at [Alley 26](http://www.alleytwentysix.com/)

Other collaborations included:

* Blues dance band [Mudbones Blues Review](http://www.facebook.com/Mudbones.Blues)
* Jazz and R&B group [Angie and The Cool Network](http://angieandthecoolnetwork.com/)
* Celtic/world musician [James Olin Oden](http://www.jamesoden.com/)

I set big audacious goals for myself and push myself to continually learn and improve my musicianship. My daily routine generally includes two to four hours of practice. These days, I am playing the upright bass a lot, working on sight reading, playing arco, and transcribing songs. While I do have a full-time job, which I very much enjoy, my goal is to play at a professional level, routinely performing throughout the region and doing session work.

I owe much gratitude to my supportive wife and the many fine musicians from whom I have had the pleasure of learning.

No matter how good a musician I become, I will never be as cool as when I drove a fire truck for a living.
