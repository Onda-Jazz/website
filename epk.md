Onda is a four-piece ensemble that creates a distinctive sound playing arrangements of songs which are rarely performed elsewhere.

Formed in April 2014, Onda brings together experienced musicians who share passions for Brazilian jazz and musical exploration.

Members include:

* [Stephen Coffman]({{site.url}}/about/stephen/) (The Beast, Peter Lamb and the Wolves, Shana Tucker, NC Jazz Repertory Orchestra) on vibraphone,
* Nelson Johns (NCCU jazz studies masters student) on guitar,
* Ana Mitchell (Corn and the Colonels) on percussion, and
* [Eric Meyer]({{site.url}}/about/eric/) on upright bass.

Onda performs regularly at jazz venues throughout the triangle area.

## Reviews

"Their well-rehearsed setlist ... avoided cliches while giving life to standards by Jobim and Horace Silver. Other numbers moved between the soulful and the whimsical."
